Lendsqr
=========

## development
I started with the project structure, and moved the routes into the (pages) folder. Authentication followed, with storing mock data in the login page. I later onto the users page, with all its components, while doing its responsiveness. Finally worked on the user details page, with responsive as well.

## testing
Unit tests were done on all the page components, excluding UI components.

## How to run the app

Run (npm run dev) from the main directory to compile for development. To test run (npm run test).
