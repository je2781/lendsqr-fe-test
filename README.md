Lendsqr
=========

## development
I started with the project structure, and moved the routes into the (pages) folder to allow for a global state provider controlling authentication. As this is a limited implementation of a fullsatck app, the global state is used to reset the route stack.

## testing
Unit tests were done on all the page components, excluding UI components.

## How to run the app

Run (npm run dev) from the main directory to compile for development. To test run (npm run test). 

## Deployment
